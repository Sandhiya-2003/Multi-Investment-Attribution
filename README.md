Project Title: Multi-Investment Attribution

Project Topic: CAUSAL EFFECTS OF MULTI-LEVEL TREATMENT OF INTERVENTIONS USING OBSERVATIONAL DATA

Project ID: IN04

Submitted for Data Science Internship (July - October 2024) at IDEAS TIH, Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata

Problem Statement:

In a competitive business environment, companies must allocate resources across multiple customer interventions (such as tech support and discount programs) to maximize customer engagement and revenue. However, the effectiveness of these interventions can vary depending on customer characteristics (e.g., company size), and implementing multiple interventions simultaneously may have compounding or diminishing effects on revenue. 

This project aims to quantify the causal effect of each intervention (tech support and discount) on customer revenue using observational data, acknowledging the potential influence of confounding factors.
